# Findings Log Book

Append-only record of everything learned during the build of the investigation layer.

**Rules**

1. Never edit or delete an entry. To correct one, write a new entry that references the old ID.
2. Number entries sequentially from `OBS-001`.
3. Write an entry whenever any of the following is true:
   - Something in `BUILD-PLAN.md` turned out to be wrong, incomplete, or based on a false assumption.
   - Real device or fixture output did not match what the plan predicted.
   - A decision had to be made that the plan did not specify.
   - Something was implemented in a way you are not confident about.
   - A test passes but you suspect it does not really test the thing.
   - You noticed a defect, smell, or risk outside the current task's scope. **Do not fix it — log it.**
   - A dependency, version, or environment detail differed from expectation.
   - You wanted to change a file frozen by `BUILD-PLAN.md` §0.5.
4. Anything with `Needs human review: yes` must also appear in the **Open Questions** table at the bottom.
5. This log is reviewed with the human after Part 4 completes, before any MVP-1 work begins.

**Kinds:** `assumption-wrong` · `surprise` · `decision-made` · `risk` · `defect` · `deferred` · `environment` · `consultation`

`consultation` records a Fable 5 second opinion: the question asked, the answer received, and what Opus 5 did with it. Per `BUILD-PLAN.md` §0.9, an unlogged consultation is an unreviewable decision.

**Escalation.** Every finding carries the level it resolved to under §0.11: `HALT`, `DECIDE-AND-LOG`, or `NOTE`.

## OBS-001 · T-000 · Documentation pack was not installed at first launch

- **Kind:** environment
- **Escalation:** NOTE
- **Model:** opus-5
- **What happened:** `BUILD-PLAN.md` §0.8 and the per-task loop both assume `docs/design/` and `docs/build/` already exist inside the repository. They did not. The pack was staged in a separate folder alongside the checkout, and the first session was launched from that folder rather than from the repo, so the required-reading paths did not resolve and there was no `CLAUDE.md`, no source tree, and no `Makefile` at the working directory. The pack has since been installed into the checkout and committed.
- **Evidence:** Commit `6629a2c docs: add design and build documentation pack`. `docs/design/{glossary,design-thinking,lld-investigation-layer,interfaces}.md` and `docs/build/{BUILD-PLAN,TRACKER,FINDINGS}.md` now resolve. The upstream staging copy remains at `/home/rami/ai-agent-ops/docs-source/` and is not authoritative.
- **What I did:** Nothing to the plan. Verified the installed copies are byte-identical to the upstream pack (`cmp` across all four design docs and `BUILD-PLAN.md` — all identical) so the reading done against the staged copies is valid. Recording the sequencing gap because the plan has no T-000 and therefore no home for "get the plan into the repo".
- **Needs human review:** no
- **Blocks:** none

## OBS-002 · T-000 · `.gitignore` silently excluded `docs/build/`

- **Kind:** defect
- **Escalation:** NOTE
- **Model:** opus-5
- **What happened:** `.gitignore` line 17 was an unanchored `build/` rule, intended for the stale `build/lib/` artifact directory described in `CLAUDE.md`. Unanchored gitignore patterns match at *any* depth, so the rule also excluded `docs/build/`. `BUILD-PLAN.md`, `TRACKER.md` and `FINDINGS.md` were silently dropped from the first documentation commit while `git add` reported success and exited zero. The failure is silent by construction: git does not warn when an `add` matches an ignored path unless `-f` is used.
- **Evidence:** `.gitignore` line 17, now reading `/build/`. The three files are present in the tree at commit `6629a2c`.
- **What I did:** Anchored the rule to `/build/` so it matches only the repository-root artifact directory. Logging it rather than treating it as closed, because the same class of silent exclusion could hit `tests/fixtures/` at T-011 — fixture capture writes many new files at once, and an ignored path there would mean parsers are later written against fixtures that exist locally and not in the commit. Mitigation at T-011: verify with `git status --ignored` and confirm the expected file count in the commit rather than trusting `git add`'s exit code.
- **Needs human review:** no
- **Blocks:** none — but see the T-011 mitigation above.

## OBS-003 · T-001 · Baseline is green, and matches the documented counts exactly

- **Kind:** environment
- **Escalation:** NOTE
- **Model:** opus-5
- **What happened:** Baseline verified at the repository's current on-disk location after the move and venv rebuild. `make test` → **550 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failed** in 4.42s. `make lint` (`ruff check .`) → **All checks passed!**, exit 0. The 550+4 total of 554 matches `CLAUDE.md`'s documented count exactly, and all four skips are the `live_lab` tier self-skipping for want of `NETTOOLS_LIVE_LAB=1` — the one skip class `BUILD-PLAN.md` T-001 explicitly permits. Nothing is red and nothing is skipped for an undocumented reason.
- **Evidence:**
  - Baseline commit: `6629a2c059d0e848c58b1ef279a063a91f2322c8` (`docs: add design and build documentation pack`), branch `feat/investigation-layer`.
  - Working tree at baseline: clean except `docs/build/FINDINGS.md`, modified by this run's own OBS-001/OBS-002 entries.
  - Skip reason (`pytest -q -rs`): `SKIPPED [4] tests/test_live_lab.py:37: Live-lab tests need NETTOOLS_LIVE_LAB=1 plus a reachable lab and real DEVICE_USERNAME/DEVICE_PASSWORD`.
  - Package version: `agent_nettools.__version__` = `0.2.0`; installed dist `agent-nettools` = `0.2.0`.
  - Repository path: `/home/rami/ai-agent-ops/ios-xr-nettools` (moved before this session; venv rebuilt in place, `which python` resolves inside `.venv`).
  - Environment: Python **3.13.11** (Anaconda build, GCC 14.3.0), `Linux-6.8.0-136-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.39`, x86_64. `pip list` → 63 packages. ruff 0.16.3, pytest 9.1.1.
- **What I did:** Judged T-001 accepted. Recorded the counts above as the reference the rest of the plan measures against: **any future run showing fewer than 550 passed, or a skip outside `tests/test_live_lab.py`, is a regression introduced by this build and not pre-existing.**
- **Needs human review:** no
- **Blocks:** none

## OBS-004 · T-001 · Local interpreter is Python 3.13; CI pins 3.11

- **Kind:** environment
- **Escalation:** NOTE
- **Model:** opus-5
- **What happened:** The rebuilt venv runs Python 3.13.11, while `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pins `python-version: "3.11"`. `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.10"`, so both are inside the supported range and neither is wrong. But the green baseline recorded in OBS-003 is evidence about 3.13 only — it is not evidence that the suite is green on the version CI will actually run.
- **Evidence:** `python -VV` → `Python 3.13.11 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc.`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml:14` → `python-version: "3.11"`; `pyproject.toml:10` → `requires-python = ">=3.10"`.
- **What I did:** Nothing — logged only, per §0.11 NOTE. Flagging it now because this build adds a parsing library at T-008 and six parsers at T-012–T-017. A dependency that resolves to different versions on 3.11 and 3.13, or parser behaviour that depends on a stdlib change between them, would surface as a CI-only failure well after the code was judged accepted locally. The cheap mitigation, if it ever bites, is one 3.11 run before the final commit rather than a matrix.
- **Needs human review:** no
- **Blocks:** none

## OBS-005 · T-002 · MiniMax contract verified — `reasoning_split` works, Q-001 resolved

- **Kind:** surprise
- **Escalation:** DECIDE-AND-LOG
- **Model:** opus-5
- **What happened:** All six checks ran against the live endpoint. **Acceptance is met: checks 1, 2 and 4 pass.** The plan's central worry is confirmed as real *and* solved: by default the model does leak reasoning into `content` inside `<think>` tags and the result does **not** parse as JSON; with `"reasoning_split": true` the tags are gone, the content parses as JSON, and the reasoning is returned separately.

  | # | Check | Verdict | Result |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Auth and reachability | **PASS** | HTTP 200, content returned |
  | 2 | Model ID `MiniMax-M3` accepted | **PASS** | `model='MiniMax-M3'` echoed back |
  | 3 | `<think>` leakage, default | INFO | **`<think>` PRESENT**, `parses_as_json=False` |
  | 4 | `reasoning_split: true` suppresses it | **PASS** | no `<think>`, `parses_as_json=True`, reasoning in `reasoning_content`/`reasoning_details` |
  | 5 | Determinism at temperature 0 | INFO | **5/5 byte-identical**, 1 distinct value, 0 failures |
  | 6 | Tool calling | INFO | `tool_calls` returned: `['get_bgp_neighbor_state']` |

  Check 3's content was literally `'<think>The user wants me to return only the JSON object…</think>\n\n{"decision":"narrow",…}'` — a leading think block followed by the correct JSON. A naive `json.loads` on that raises; a naive "find the first `{`" would work today and break the first time the reasoning text itself contains a brace. Neither is needed, because check 4 passes.
- **Evidence:** `scripts/probe_minimax.py`, exit 0, `ACCEPTANCE: met`. Prompt for checks 3–5 is the verbatim one from `BUILD-PLAN.md` T-002, kept as a module constant so a re-run stays comparable.
- **What I did:** Judged T-002 accepted. **Resolved Q-001: no `<think>`-stripping step is needed** — `reasoning_split: true` is sufficient and must be set explicitly on every call in T-003. Two consequences recorded for downstream tasks: 5/5 determinism at temperature 0 means the gate's typed-decision output is reproducible enough to golden-test directly (T-026/T-027), and working tool calling removes the constraint the LLD §10.3 flagged for MVP-1 — though MVP-0 needs none of it.
- **Needs human review:** no
- **Blocks:** none — unblocks T-003.

## OBS-006 · T-002 · Reasoning is billed to `max_completion_tokens`, and a small budget returns empty content with no error

- **Kind:** risk
- **Escalation:** DECIDE-AND-LOG
- **Model:** opus-5
- **What happened:** Check 1 was written with `max_completion_tokens: 16` per the plan, and its content came back as a *truncated `<think>` fragment* rather than an answer. A follow-up measurement at four budgets, all with `reasoning_split: true`, shows why: reasoning counts against the completion budget even when it is split out of `content`.

  | `max_completion_tokens` | `finish_reason` | `completion_tokens` | `content` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 16 | `length` | 16 | **`''` (empty)** |
  | 64 | `stop` | 17 | `'ok'` |
  | 2048 | `stop` | 15 | `'ok'` |
  | 4096 | `stop` | 23 | `'ok'` |

  The 16-token row is the dangerous one. There is **no error, no exception, and no non-zero status** — just `finish_reason: "length"` and an empty string. Code that reads `content` and moves on would treat "the model never got to answer" as "the model answered with nothing." That is the same failure shape `health.py` refuses with `unevaluated`, and the same one this repo already rejected in `parsers.py` ("a parse yielding neither records nor meta from non-empty input is a failure, never a silent empty success").
- **Evidence:** Measurement above, run through `probe_minimax.call()`. Also visible in check 1's recorded evidence: `content='<think>The user is asking me to reply with the single word "ok". This</think>'` — cut mid-sentence at the budget.
- **What I did:** Logged only; no code exists yet to fix. **Binding requirement recorded for T-003:** the MiniMax provider must treat `finish_reason == "length"` with empty or unparseable `content` as a structured error, never as an answer, and must not rely on the endpoint's default budget. This is a spec item for that task, not a suggestion.
- **Needs human review:** no
- **Blocks:** T-003 (as a requirement, not a blocker).

## OBS-007 · T-002 · The documented 2048 cap on `max_completion_tokens` did not reproduce

- **Kind:** assumption-wrong
- **Escalation:** NOTE
- **Model:** opus-5
- **What happened:** `BUILD-PLAN.md` T-002 background states that `max_completion_tokens` on the OpenAI-compatible route "is documented as capped at 2048". A request with `max_completion_tokens: 4096` was accepted and answered normally — no error, no warning, no error envelope.
- **Evidence:** Row D of the OBS-006 measurement: `max_completion_tokens=4096` → `finish_reason=stop`, `completion_tokens=23`, content `'ok'`.
- **What I did:** Logged only. **Stating the limit of this evidence honestly: this shows 4096 is not *rejected*, not that it is *honoured*.** The answer was 23 tokens long, far below either ceiling, so silent clamping to 2048 is fully consistent with what was observed and is not ruled out. Distinguishing the two needs a prompt that deliberately generates more than 2048 tokens, which was not worth an API call at this stage. The safe course, and what T-003 should do, is to treat 2048 as the effective ceiling regardless — it costs nothing and is correct under both readings.
- **Needs human review:** no
- **Blocks:** none

## OBS-008 · T-002 · The API key was pasted into the session transcript

- **Kind:** risk
- **Escalation:** NOTE
- **Model:** opus-5
- **What happened:** `MINIMAX_API_KEY` was not present in the environment or `.env` at the start of T-002, contradicting the session brief. The operator supplied it by pasting it directly into the chat. It is now in this session's conversation transcript, which is stored outside the repository and is not covered by `.gitignore`, `scrub_output`, or any control this project owns.
- **Evidence:** The key was absent from the environment, `.env`, `.env.example`, all shell profiles, and every repository file except the plan documents that merely name the variable. It now lives at `.env` (confirmed matched by `.gitignore:4` before writing, via `git check-ignore -v`), which is the home `BUILD-PLAN.md` §0.7 prescribes.
- **What I did:** Wrote it to the gitignored `.env` rather than exporting it on a command line, so it is not captured in shell history or a process listing, and verified `git status` does not see `.env`. The key has never been echoed, and `probe_minimax.py` carries a `Redactor` that rewrites it out of any line the script prints, including tracebacks. **Recommending rotation** once this build is finished — not because anything here mishandled it, but because a transcript is a copy nobody in this repository can revoke. Flagging rather than acting: rotating a credential is the operator's call.
- **Needs human review:** yes
- **Blocks:** none

# Open Questions

Anything logged with `Needs human review: yes` is mirrored here so the review has one list to work from.

| ID | Raised in | Question | Blocking? | Status |
|----|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Q-001 | T-002 | Does `reasoning_split: true` fully suppress `<think>` in `content`? If not, is a stripping step acceptable, or should the gate use the Anthropic-compatible route instead? | Yes — gate depends on it | **Resolved (OBS-005)** — yes, fully. No stripping step, no route change. Must be set explicitly on every call. |
| Q-002 | T-004 | Is syslog-ng shipping to Loki, and do IOS-XR mnemonics survive into a queryable label? | No — affects Stage 2 only | Open |
| Q-003 | T-005 | Does Alertmanager have a webhook receiver, and can it replace n8n as the Stage 2 trigger? | No — Stage 2 | Open |
| Q-004 | T-006 | What is the subject naming scheme for an L3VPN service object? | No — flow not in MVP-0 | Open |
| Q-005 | T-020 | What error-counter threshold should `interface_state` treat as broken? | No — default chosen, needs review | Open |
| Q-006 | T-025 | Does the descent's stopping rung match what a network engineer would conclude by hand from the same fixtures? | **Yes — this validates the architecture** | Open |
| Q-007 | T-035 | Telegram or Mattermost? Hosted means device names, IPs and RCA text leave the estate; self-hosted keeps them in. Decide before implementing — only one provider gets built. | Yes for T-035 | Open |
| Q-008 | T-035 | Which host runs `nettools` in the target deployment, and does it have outbound egress to the chosen channel? | Yes for T-035 | Open |
| Q-009 | T-002 | Should `MINIMAX_API_KEY` be rotated after this build? It was pasted into the session transcript, which no control in this repository can revoke. | No — nothing is blocked on it | Open — recommended (OBS-008) |
